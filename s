Hello dear Specz user, üòÅ

If you see this, we just wanted to say to you that Specz is discontinued. 
Because of; 

  - Programmer missing time.
    - Because of school.

  - No ideas.
    - I dont know what to put here

  - Only 1 person working on Specz.
    - We can't find a team. We dont have any money to hire anyone

  - Script is hard to understand
    - Specz was created a long time ago, i was younger and i was not that experienced in scripting. My script wasn't that organized.

You can still download Specz. Source code will be published. (71 files)
(If you use it please credit me ‚ù§)
